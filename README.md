# QA-final-project
Why are we doing this?
        - This is our final QA project to complete the software development course. In this project we can showcase everything we have been learning over the past 9 weeks.

How I expected the challenge to go.
        - I expected the challenger to go well as I felt quite comfortable with creating CRUD functionality and using databases to hold the information. I thought i ould have struggled with the postman requests as I struggled to get them to work the first time we praticed it.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
        - I found that suprisingly the postman requests went well and work as I had expected as well as the rest of the porejct working fine. I struggled with the testing element as I found it hard to get a high percentage of my project covered but I managed to get over 80% in the end after tweaking it for a while.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
        - I would like to add functionality for making it so you can only have 5 players per team as well as implementing a budget system to work alongside the price object in my project. Finally if possible I'd like to make it so you can only have a max of 2 'star players' per team.
